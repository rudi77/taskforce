      Mission: |
        Instructions:

        Identify Currency Information:

        Locate any currency symbols (e.g., $, €, £) and currency codes (e.g., USD, EUR, GBP).
        Determine the base currency (currency in which the invoice is issued) and the target currency (currency to which the invoice will be converted).
        Locate FX Rates:

        Look for sections or lines in the invoice that mention "Exchange Rate", "FX Rate", "Conversion Rate", "Rate of Exchange", or similar terms.
        FX rates might be presented as numerical values often accompanied by currency codes (e.g., 1 USD = 0.85 EUR).
        Read Surrounding Context:

        Pay attention to the context around numerical values to ensure they represent FX rates and not other financial figures (e.g., total amount, tax rate).
        Common formats include: "1 [Base Currency] = [FX Rate] [Target Currency]" or simply "[FX Rate] [Target Currency] per 1 [Base Currency]".
        Extract and Validate:

        Extract all FX rates ensuring they are correctly associated with the base and target currencies.
        Validate the extracted rates to ensure they fall within reasonable real-world values (e.g., between 0.5 and 2.0 for major currency pairs).
        Output the FX Rates:

        Present all FX rates in the following JSON format:
        [
          {
            "base_currency": "<BaseCurrency>",
            "target_currency": "<TargetCurrency>",
            "fx_rate": <FXRate>
          },
          {
            "base_currency": "<BaseCurrency>",
            "target_currency": "<TargetCurrency>",
            "fx_rate": <FXRate>
          }
        ]

        To guide you, here is an example of previous interactions that were correctly handled:

        Example:

        User: Extract all Foreign Exchange (FX) Rates from the invoice and return them as a JSON object.
        
        Given the following text from an invoice:

        Invoice Date: 2024-05-01
        Total Amount: $1000
        Exchange Rate: 1 USD = 0.85 EUR
        Special Rate: 1 GBP = 1.15 EUR
        Payment Terms: Net 30 days
        The extracted FX Rates should be:

        json
        [
          {
            "base_currency": "USD",
            "target_currency": "EUR",
            "fx_rate": 0.85
          },
          {
            "base_currency": "GBP",
            "target_currency": "EUR",
            "fx_rate": 1.15
          }
        ]
        Additional Notes:

        - If multiple FX rates are present, extract all relevant rates and specify their applicable sections if indicated.
        - Handle variations in terminology and formatting that may differ across invoices.

            "target_currency": "<TargetCurrency>",
            "fx_rate": <FXRate>
          },
          {
            "base_currency": "<BaseCurrency>",
            "target_currency": "<TargetCurrency>",
            "fx_rate": <FXRate>
          }
        ]

        Process the invoice provided by the user and extract the necessary line items.
